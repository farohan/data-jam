        <h3 class="paragraph-title"> 2. Introduction </h3>
        <p class="report"> Ever since agriculture began about 12,000 years ago, people have been using pesticides, or more specifically, insecticides. 
            The insecticides started out as 100% natural substances like sulfur. 
            However, more and more toxic chemicals have been used to create insecticides since. 
            That has had detrimental effects on the environment and ecosystem, killing bees and shattering the delicate balance that Nature had before. 
            But recently in the 20th century, scientists have found a species of bacteria called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that can also kill pests when applied to plants, such as corn and wheat. 
            These bacteria have done no harm to bees so far. 
            But is this too good to be true? 
            Are these bacteria really that safe?
            Should we use them more or less or stop using them altogether? 
            In this report, you will learn about what Bt is in more detail, 
            the effects that it has on our environment compared to insecticides, 
            which one is more sustainable and better for agriculture, and more. </p>

        <h3 class="paragraph-title"> 3. Dataset Description </h3>
        <p class="report">
            From 1939 up to 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
            National Agricultural Statistic Service (USDA/NASS)
            carried out surveys throughout the entire United States.
            Their goal was to get an estimation about how well agriculture was going in the U.S.
            and what they could do to make it more effective.
            All of the data in this report — statistics, graphs, charts — comes from the USDA/NASS survey,
            and its variables include: the year, the number of honey bee colonies (in the thousands), 
            the pounds of insecticides (in the millions) used, 
            and the percentage of acres reserved for growing corn that use Bt.
        </p>

        <h3 class="paragraph-title"> Insecticides </h3>
        <p class="report"> The insecticides today are far more dangerous than the ones used in the past. 
            Both plants and animals have suffered from this, 
            especially important pollinating insects like honey bees. 
            Here are two charts that show the correlation 
            between the amount of insecticides used 
            and the number of honey bee colonies in the United States: </p>

        <div id="data-photo-div">
            <img class="data-photos" id="data-photo1" src="photos/insecticides.png" alt="Amount of insecticides used throughout the years" height="300" width="425">
            <img class="data-photos" id="data-photo2" src="photos/honeybees.png" alt="Number of Honey Bee Colonies in the United States Throughout the Years" height="300" width="425">
        </div>

        <p class="note"> <strong> Reminder: </strong> The number of honey bee colonies is in the thousands (e.g. 6000 thousands would be six million). </p>

        <h4 class="paragraph-title">5. Data Trends and Comparisons</h4>

        <p class="report"> In these charts, you can see that the number of bee colonies is only about one-third of what it used to be in the 1940's, that is, when insecticides were used less. 
            As insecticides were used more and more, the number of U.S. honey bee colonies decreased. 
            You can especially see that in the 1960's and 1970's; the years when insecticide use skyrocketed and the bee population collapsed.
            It continued diving until the early 90's, showing the long-term damage that insecticides have had on honey bees. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="paragraph-title">6. Data Interpretation</h4>

        <p class="report">
            But why are the data and charts like this? 
            Why does the honey bee population decrease when insecticides are used more? 
            There could be many reasons as to why, 
            but I believe it’s because of how toxic the insecticides are. 
            Humans face lots of health problems (see Sources down below) if they are exposed to insecticides for a long time, 
            and since bees are much smaller than humans, even a short amount of time may be fatal. 
            In addition to that, insecticides have chronic effects on the environment. 
            That’s why even when insecticide-use lessened, 
            the number of honey bee colonies in the United States continued to decline. 
        </p>
            
        <h4 class="paragraph-title">7. New Questions and Hypotheses</h4>
            
        <p class="report">
            This brings up a few questions and hypotheses.
            The first question I have is how long does it exactly take for insecticides to
            "wash" away completely and no longer damage the ecosystem?
            I notice that similar to the amount of insecticides used,
            the bee colonies disappeared between 1960 and the 2000's.
            Perhaps it takes about 40 to 50 years for insecticides (in general) to have at least diluted
            effects on plants and animals.
            Or it could take more or less time; more research could be done on that and what variables lengthen or shorten that time.
            Now to my second question: Beyond the range of the charts, 
            did insecticide-use affect honey bees in any way?
            One hypothesis that I have is that maybe insecticides did affect bees.
            In fact, you can see the number of bee colonies increasing from a little 
            more than 4,000 in 1939 to about 6,000 in 1948 or so.
            At the same time, insecticides were being used at a fairly constant rate.
            I think the honey bees were recovering from the toxicity of the insecticides.
        </p>

        <h3 class="paragraph-title"> Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) </h3>

        <p class="report"> Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a species of bacteria found in soil. 
            It was discovered in 1901 by a Japanese scientist and was rediscovered by a German scientist in 1911.
            It was first used commercially as a spray in the U.S. in 1958 and has been used since for agriculture. 
            Bt is introduced to plants in two ways: sprays and genetic engineering. 
            Now here is another set of charts that show what happened to bees after Bt was used on a large scale in the 1990's: </p>

        <div id="data-photo-div2">
            <img class="data-photos" id="data-photo11" src="photos/btcorn.png" alt="Amount of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) used throughout the years" height="300" width="425">
            <img class="data-photos" id="data-photo22" src="photos/honeybees.png" alt="Chart of honey bee population in the U.S." height="300" width="425">
        </div>

        <h4 class="paragraph-title">5. Data Trends and Comparisons</h4>

        <p class="report"> Looking at these charts, it seems that Bt has no effect on bees, whether positive or negative. 
            Honey bee populations remained the same, even after the bacteria was used so much that more than 75% — or three-fourths — of corn fields in the United States contained Bt. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="paragraph-title">6. Data Interpretation</h4>

        <p class="report">
            But what is the science behind this? 
            Why doesn’t Bt do anything to bees? 
            The secret here is that Bt becomes active and deadly <i>only</i> when it is eaten by particular insects, 
            which does not include pollinating honey bees. 
            This makes Bt a sort of selective insecticide. 
            After reading this, you may be wondering, 
            “Why isn’t everyone using Bt in their gardens, then?” 
            Well, there is one caveat: 
            For instance, let’s say everyone starts using Bt in their gardens, 
            and they are able to kill 99% of all pests. 
            What about that 1%, though? That 1% of pests has just become resistant to Bt. 
            Their offspring will also be resistant to Bt, which just recreates the pest problem. 
            This is true for human-made insecticides, as well. 
            The few surviving insects will become resistant, thus transforming into “super-insects”,
            and thus regulating over-use. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="paragraph-title">7. New Questions and Hypotheses</h4>

        <p class="report">
            One question that comes to mind after seeing all this is 
            if insecticides stop being used entirely and everyone uses Bt that 
            can somehow kill 100% of all pests and insects, will bee populations start to 
            rise again? I believe it will rise again because Bt doesn't do anything, 
            unlike insecticides, as proved by my charts  
            and some other experiments done by scientists and researchers.
            Another question I have is if we use 
            Bt and insecticides in different areas for the next, let's say, six months,
            what will happen to bees?
            I think the areas with Bt will do much better than the areas with insecticides,
            in terms of how many bees there are left in six months.
            Again, Bt is not at all harmful to honeybees, while insecticides are.
        </p>    

        <h3 class="paragraph-title"> Conclusion </h3>

        <p class="report"> Today, we looked at two ways of protecting plants from pests and other unwanted insects.
            One way was using insecticides. 
            That kills bees and isn't good for us humans in general as well.
            The other way of protecting plants was using a bacteria found in the soil called Bacillus thuringiensis.
            Bt hasn't caused any damage to honeybees, crops, or humans yet. 
            However, while using Bt excessively is tempting, 
            certain, hardy insects may grow resistant to the bacteria and continue to cause problems.
            So the next time you drive in the countryside or past a farm, why not take a few seconds to think about bees, the lovely gardeners of our Earth. </p>
