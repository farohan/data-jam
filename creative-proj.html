    <h1> Creative Project Explanation </h1>
    <div>
        <q>When I chose to take on the Hudson Data Jam Competition, I knew I had many options as to what I would do for a creative component.
            I thought and contemplated for a few days on what I should do. Finally, it came to me. 
            I could build a website! It's simple, lightweight, easily accessible, and better yet, I could intertwine the report and my website, my creative component.
            All I hope now is that it teaches <em>everyone</em> about honeybees and their role in the ecosystem.
